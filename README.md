OneTable
OneTable helps parents ensure their children are growing strong by tracking daily intake and identifying key nutrient gaps. By logging meals, parents get instant feedback on whether their childâ€™s nutrition is on track. Using pediatric dietary guidelines and personalized recommendations, OneTable makes healthy eating simple, smart, and reliable. Besides, OneTable aims to empower underprivileged families by creating a community network where they can request groceries to meet their nutritional needs. This will ensure consistent access to essential nutrients and improve overall health outcomes for those in need.
